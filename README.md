# Words

This is a project that I started to help my son learning English words -- we're
Brazilians, so we natively speak Portuguese.

It uses [Web Speech API][1] to say a word, and then you have to choose the
right image associated to that word.

## Changelog

### 0.0.2

* Minor design improvements (added [Bootstrap][2] stylesheet).
* Increased the word list.
* Using spoken feedback instead of textual after picking a picture.
* Improved "next word" logic to avoid repeating words during a match.

### 0.0.1

* First release. A very simple "game" where you hear a word and choose between
    3 pictures wich one represents best that word.
